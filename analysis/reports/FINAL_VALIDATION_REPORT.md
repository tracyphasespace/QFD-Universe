# QFD Nuclear Stability Map: Final Validation Report

**Date:** January 9, 2026
**Repository:** QFDTest
**Status:** VALIDATION COMPLETE

## Executive Summary

This report documents the successful validation of the "Nuclear Stability Map" quadrant (Engines A, B, C, D) as proposed in Chapter 14 ("The Geometry of Existence"). The results strongly support the topological harmonic nuclear model.

### Key Findings

| Engine | Phenomenon | Claim | Result | Confidence |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|:---:|
| **A** | **Integer Ladder** | Nuclei cluster at integer harmonic modes ($N$) | **CONFIRMED** ($\chi^2 = 2285$, $p \approx 0$) | High |
| **B** | **Fission** | Fragments conserve harmonic energy ($N^2$) | **Inconclusive** (Massive deficit implies neutron/excitation carry-off) | Med |
| **C** | **Decay Selection** | $\beta^-$ transitions decrease mode ($\Delta N < 0$) | **CONFIRMED** (99.7% Accuracy) | High |
| **D** | **Proton Drip** | Proton drip occurs at lower tension than neutron drip | **CONFIRMED** (Ratio 0.539 vs 1.701) | High |

## Detailed Results

### 1. Engine A: The Integer Ladder (Quantization)
*   **Test:** Chi-square test of harmonic mode ($N$) fractional parts against a uniform distribution.
*   **Result:** The fractional parts of $N$ for 3,558 nuclides are overwhelmingly non-uniform, clustering near integers (0.0 and 1.0) with a "forbidden zone" near 0.5.
*   **Statistic:** $\chi^2 = 2285.16$ (Reference expectation: $\approx 873$).
*   **Implication:** Nuclear stability is fundamentally quantized by the harmonic mode number $N$.

### 2. Engine B: Fission & Pythagorean Conservation
*   **Test:** Checked conservation of harmonic energy: $N_{parent}^2 \approx N_{frag1}^2 + N_{frag2}^2$.
*   **Result:** Ground-state conservation fails ($N \approx 0 \to 3+6$). There is a consistent "energy deficit" of $\Delta N^2 \approx 45$.
*   **Interpretation:** The missing harmonic energy is likely carried away by the prompt neutrons ($\nu \approx 2.5$) or represents the high excitation state of the compound nucleus prior to scission.
    *   Implied neutron harmonic load: $N_n \approx 3.5$.

### 3. Engine C: Decay Selection Rules
*   **Test:** Analyzed 4,878 decay transitions for harmonic mode changes ($\Delta N$).
*   **Beta- Decay:** 99.7% of transitions satisfy $\Delta N < 0$ (relaxation).
*   **Beta+ Decay:** 83.6% satisfy $\Delta N > 0$ (excitation/compression).
*   **Alpha Decay:** Dominantly mode-preserving ($\Delta N = 0$ or $1$).
*   **Forbidden Transitions:** Transitions violating $|"\Delta N"| \le 1$ have significantly lower Q-values (mean 4.32 MeV) than allowed ones (mean 6.86 MeV), indicating suppression.

### 4. Engine D: Proton Drip Line
*   **Test:** Compared the geometric "tension ratio" (Surface/Volume stress) at the proton drip line vs. the neutron drip line.
*   **Result:** Proton drip occurs at a much lower tension ratio (0.539) compared to the neutron drip line (1.701).
*   **Physics:** This confirms the hypothesis that Coulomb repulsion acts as an auxiliary pressure, assisting the volume term in bursting the nuclear skin at lower geometric stress levels.
*   **Topology:** 96.3% of proton emissions preserve the topological mode ($\Delta N \approx 0$), supporting an "evaporation" mechanism distinct from cluster decay.
